\title{A class to sequentially estimate univariate pdfs, cdfs and quantile functions}
\usage{
hermite_estimator_univar(N = 10, standardize = FALSE, exp_weight_lambda = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{An integer between 0 and 75. The Hermite series based estimator
is truncated at N+1 terms.}

\item{standardize}{A boolean value. Determines whether the observations are
standardized, a transformation which often improves performance.}

\item{exp_weight_lambda}{A numerical value between 0 and 1. This parameter
controls the exponential weighting of the Hermite series based estimator.
If this parameter is NA, no exponential weighting is applied.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class hermite_estimator_univar, with methods for
density function, distribution function and quantile function estimation.
}
\description{
This method constructs an S3 object with associated methods for univariate
nonparametric estimation of pdfs, cdfs and quantiles.
}
\details{
The hermite_estimator_univar class allows the sequential or one-pass batch
estimation of the full probability density function, cumulative distribution
function and quantile function. It is well suited to streaming data (both
stationary and non-stationary) and to efficient estimation in the context of
massive or distributed data sets. Indeed, estimators constructed on different
subsets of a distributed data set can be consistently merged.
