Description: Facilitates estimation of full univariate and bivariate 
  probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions along with
  full quantile functions (univariate) and Spearman's rank correlation 
  (bivariate) using Hermite series based estimators. These estimators are 
  particularly useful in the sequential setting (both stationary and 
  non-stationary) and one-pass batch estimation setting for large data sets.
